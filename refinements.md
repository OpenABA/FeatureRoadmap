# Audio Feedback

 When a student makes a correct responses, play a brief 1s audio sound.

 Desired functionality:
 * Plays by default, but the session setup and manage panel provide a switch to turn it off.
 * Audio can be selected in the session setup page, and changed in the management panel (incase the student requests a change).
 * This functionality would be applied across all instructional activities that are currently available.

 # Observing incorrect responses

 When a student makes an incorrect response, show the proctor which response was made.

 # Block Response Mashing

 Currently students can mash the correct response. Two ways to block this:
 * 1) Shuffle the array after correct responses.
 * 2) Possibly introduce a 'wipe' transition; each time the student is correct, the array and exemplar 'wipe left' off screen, and the new array and exemplar 'wipe right' into the screen.

 # Drag-and-drop for Matching

 Currently the student clicks on the matching card. It would be cool to specify how the respond, either by clicking the matching card OR by clicking-and-dragging the card beside the exemplar.

 # Automated Exemplar Generation

 Currently the proctor is required to click-to-add each 'foil' or incorrect response across activities.

 One way to refine the user experience might be to have an 'auto-generate foils' button, whereby the app automatically populates 3-4 exemplars from that same category into the activity. So if the user presses the 'auto-generate foils' button twice, 6-8 foils will appear (3-4 for each click).
