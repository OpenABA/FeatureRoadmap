# OpenABA Feature Roadmap Repository

OpenABA is a community driven effort to digitize intervention sessions.

Here we list features we are [actively engineering for deployment](./active.md), [refinements](./refinements.md) of current features as requested by the community, and [future features](./future.md) that we will work to implement at a later date.

If you wish to request a feature, simply open an issue and we will add it to one of our roadmap lists.
